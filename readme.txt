Using Python processing this program uses an L-system approach to procedural generation of art. Strings were generated using 'rules' which are then read by an interpreter - interpreting the string's instructions to print things to the canvas. Images were generated by varying parameters, randomizing parameters, and adjusting rulesets within the L-System.
